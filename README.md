# OCaml-SPF

## Introduction

This library provides OCaml bindings to [libspf2](http://www.libspf2.org/).

## Build and installation

OCaml-SPF can be installed via opam.

    $ opam install spf

## Notes

It is strongly recommended that a [patched libspf2 with fixes collected from
the SPF-devel mailing list](https://github.com/andrenth/libspf2) is used
instead of the current official libspf2 release (version 1.2.10).
